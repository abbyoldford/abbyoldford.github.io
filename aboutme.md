My name is Abby Oldford. I am a Kinesiology undergraduate student at the University of Calgary, majoring in Coaching and Leadership with an Embedded Certificate in Mental Wellbeing and Resilience. 

Prior to signing up for KNES 381, I would say my computer skills were basic, however this course has provided me with so many skills and tools that I look forward to using in the future. I created this website to highlight some of the tools I have learned. 

I would describe myself as an active person who enjoys weightlifting and being outdoors, therefore you will see a lot of fitness related activity throughout this website, in fact most of the scenery photos were taken by me!
